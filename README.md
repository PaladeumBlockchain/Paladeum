What is Paladeum?
----------------

Paladeum is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. The Paladeum platform also lets anyone create tokens (tokens) on the Paladeum network.
Tokens can be used for NFTs, STOs, Gift Cards, and fractional ownership of anything of value.
Paladeum uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network.
